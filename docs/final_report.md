## 1. Introduction

This project set out to explore whether image segmentation techniques—specifically K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means—could enhance land use classification of satellite images. The underlying hypothesis was that segmenting images before feature extraction might improve classification performance by isolating relevant regions from background noise. The original research compared K-Means and fuzzy segmentation; here, both methods were implemented and evaluated individually against their corresponding feature datasets.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Segmentation Techniques

- **K-Means Segmentation:**  
  Pixels are clustered based on Euclidean distances in color space, and the output image is generated by replacing each pixel's color with that of its cluster centroid.

- **Fuzzy C-Means Segmentation:**  
  This soft clustering technique assigns each pixel a degree of membership across clusters, allowing pixels to belong to multiple clusters. Different values of _k_ (number of segments) were evaluated to determine the optimal level of segmentation.

### 2.2 Feature Extraction and Classification

For classification, features were extracted as follows:

- **Raw Feature Extraction:**  
  Combined color and texture features were directly extracted from the entire image.

- **Segmented Feature Extraction:**  
  For K-Means and Fuzzy segmentation, features were aggregated from the segmented regions. Each segmentation method had its own feature dataset.

A Support Vector Classifier (SVC) was trained on each feature set. The evaluation focused on how well each model performed when tested on the dataset corresponding to the segmentation method used for training (i.e., Raw Model on raw features, K-Means Model on K-Means features, and Fuzzy Model on Fuzzy features).

### 2.3 Evaluation Pipeline

The evaluation pipeline:
- Built test datasets from a CSV file with image filenames and ground truth class labels.
- Evaluated each model only on its own feature dataset.
- Reported per-class accuracy, overall accuracy, and prediction times.
- For Fuzzy segmentation, a range of _k_ values (1–5) was tested to study the effect of segmentation granularity on model performance.

## 3. Results

The full pipeline evaluation was conducted on 500 images. The key results for each model on its own dataset are summarized below:

### 3.1 Raw Model on Raw Features
- **Overall Accuracy:** 62.0%
- **Per-class Accuracy:**  
  - Ranged from 12.50% (Highway) to 95.00% (Forest)
- **Prediction Time:** Approximately 0.21 seconds

### 3.2 K-Means Model on K-Means Features
- **Overall Accuracy:** 49.0%
- **Per-class Accuracy:**  
  - Varied across classes, with some classes performing well (e.g., Forest at 85.00%) and others lower (e.g., Highway at 8.33%)
- **Prediction Time:** Approximately 0.23 seconds

### 3.3 Fuzzy Model on Fuzzy Features
- **Overall Accuracy:** 48.6% (for the best fuzzy configuration at _k_ = 2)
- **Per-class Accuracy:**  
  - Displayed similar trends to the K-Means model, with variability across classes
- **Prediction Time:** Approximately 0.23 seconds

For fuzzy segmentation, the evaluation over different _k_ values yielded:
- **k = 1:** 15.0% accuracy  
- **k = 2:** 48.6% accuracy (best performance)  
- **k = 3:** 29.0% accuracy  
- **k = 4:** 22.0% accuracy  
- **k = 5:** 20.0% accuracy

The computational time to build fuzzy datasets increased substantially with higher _k_ values—from ~0.78 seconds at _k_ = 1 to ~57.56 seconds at _k_ = 5—resulting in an overall pipeline runtime of about 304.53 seconds.

## 4. Discussion

### Key Findings:
- **Raw Features Outperform Segmented Features:**  
  The Raw Model on raw features achieved a significantly higher overall accuracy (62.0%) compared to the models based on segmented features (approximately 49.0% for both K-Means and Fuzzy models). This suggests that the contextual information present in the full image is more informative for land use classification than features extracted from segmented regions.

- **Effect of Segmentation Granularity in Fuzzy Model:**  
  Fuzzy segmentation performed best at _k_ = 2, with an accuracy of 48.6%. Increasing the number of segments beyond this threshold led to a notable drop in performance, likely due to over-segmentation that diluted essential image context.

- **Efficiency Considerations:**  
  Although one of the initial hypotheses was that segmentation might offer advantages in terms of reduced data size or faster processing by focusing on fewer, more relevant regions, neither benefit was observed. The segmented datasets did not significantly reduce data size, and prediction times remained similar across all methods. In the case of fuzzy segmentation, higher values of _k_ drastically increased preprocessing time without corresponding improvements in classification accuracy.

### Insights:
- **Segmentation May Not Be Beneficial for Satellite Imagery Classification:**  
  For this dataset and task, segmenting the images before classification not only failed to improve performance but also introduced additional computational overhead. The raw images provided richer contextual cues that were crucial for accurate classification.
  
- **Task Specificity and Future Directions:**  
  While segmentation could be beneficial in scenarios where objects are clearly delineated from the background, the results indicate that for satellite imagery—where land use types are intermingled—the raw image context is more valuable. Future work may involve exploring deep learning methods that can inherently learn to focus on salient regions without explicit segmentation.

## 5. Conclusion

The hypothesis that segmentation would enhance land use classification performance was not supported by our experiments. The classifier trained on raw features outperformed those using segmented features by a considerable margin. Moreover, the potential benefits of reduced data size or faster processing with segmented images were not realized. Overall, for satellite image classification tasks, direct feature extraction from raw images appears to be the more effective approach.

### Future Recommendations:
- **Reconsider Segmentation for Satellite Imagery:**  
  For tasks like land use classification, leveraging the full image context may be more beneficial than pre-segmenting images.
- **Explore Alternative Approaches:**  
  Consider deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks that may be better suited to handle the complex textures and spatial relationships in satellite images.
- **Hybrid Feature Strategies:**  
  Investigate combining raw and segmented features to determine if a hybrid approach could capture both global context and localized details.
